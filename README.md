Modifications: 

Pinecone Initialization and Usage:
I added code to initialize Pinecone and perform operations on it. This involves checking if an index exists, creating one if it doesn't, and attempting to insert vectors into Pinecone.

Dummy Vector Function:
I introduced a text_to_vector function which is a placeholder for actual vector generation logic.

Adjustments for Vector Dimensionality:
Modifications were made to handle vector dimensionality mismatch errors.

Message Handling Modifications:
There seem to be adjustments in the way messages are handled, particularly in functions like text_message and voice_message, though without the original code, it's hard to detail the specifics.
